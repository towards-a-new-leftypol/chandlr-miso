- get embeds working
- need to implement search
- change urls / history when time-travelling
- remove duplicate threads from view (duplicate because the OP has multiple pictures)
- server-side rendering
- control to manually put in the datetime instead of using the slider
  for fine-grained control
- have some process respond to http calls from the board to inform the db of new posts
- board view, boards should support timetravel
    - need toolbar to navigate and select which boards to view
    - choose boards to display
- time slider should align times to the hour
- scrape other websites and add them in
    - i think this is more useful than the archival property, which is really
    just there to preserve links. the time travel thing is a bit of a gimmick
- "infinite" scrolling  
    - just load more!
- more granular actions to display what is causing slowdowns (esp on mobile)
- fix thumbnails for older posts ✓
- need to support flags
- need to support mod actions like saging a thread or deleting a post
- need to display the current time you are at (or Latest) ✓
- add server sent event (only when in the "present" time wise) and listen
  for new posts
