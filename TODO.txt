Done:

- server-side rendering
    - make new servant project ✓
    - copy isomorphic example ✓
    - catalog view ✓
    - thread view
    - search view
- get embeds working ✓
- need to display the current time you are at (or Latest) ✓
- need to implement search ✓
- fix thumbnails for older posts ✓
- remove duplicate threads from view (duplicate because the OP has multiple pictures) ✓
- scrape other websites and add them in ✓
    - i think this is more useful than the archival property, which is really
    just there to preserve links. the time travel thing is a bit of a gimmick

TODO:
- redo routing / add missing routes
    - selecting a time doesn't change url
    - searching doesn't have a route server-side
    - hitting back after searching for a term from the search results page
      doesn't go back. (search for A, then for B, then hit back).
- collect profiling data
    - maybe render the page with time breakdown?
        - is this possible to do automagically? some sort of monad that gives a breakdown?
    - why is going into a thread so slow compared to server side?
    - optimize rendering (especially for mobile)
      - need to profile the code, perhaps profiling the views by removing certain elements (like the body of a post)
        and measuring the rendering speed
- change urls / history when time-travelling
- control to manually put in the datetime instead of using the slider
  for fine-grained control
- have some process respond to http calls from the board to inform the db of new posts
- board view, boards should support timetravel
    - need toolbar to navigate and select which boards to view
    - choose boards to display
- time slider should align times to the hour
- "infinite" scrolling  
    - just load more!
- need to support flags
- need to support mod actions like saging a thread or deleting a post
- add server sent event (only when in the "present" time wise) and listen
  for new posts

- build navigation feature
    Site(s) > Board(s) > Thread > Post

- delete posts in thread that have been deleted.


BUGS/New Todo:
    - navigation:
        - pressing back from certain pages
        - that one anarchy with banned material thread crashes
        - refreshing search results 404's

    - search:
        - doesn't link to comments properly (goes to OP)
        - has ugly thing instead of thumbnail for comments
            - perhaps should just be >>

        - search by image (already have phash so why not?) (though not a bug...)
